# Contributing

Before creating a Pull Request with your changes to this repository, please discuss
a problem or an enhancement in the Issues page, via email or Telegram publicly listed
in [the profile](https://github.com/VanishMax).

## First contribution

If you are new to contribution process, you can take a look at the Issues page for issues with
the label "good first issue" which might be easier than other ones but put into a backlog
because of project priorities.

Or, if there is any bug or something is missing in the library, create a new issue and assign yourself to
it, if you want to make it happen by yourself. Then, make changes and open a PR that follows the instructions below.

## Pull Request process

* If there are some files needed for you but un-needed for the project, ensure you removed them or added to .gitignore before push
* Do not update dependencies
* Remember to update documentation when you add or remove a feature from library
* It is better to update examples if there is a feature that concerns it
